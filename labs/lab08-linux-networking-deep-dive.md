# LAB 08 – Linux Networking Deep Dive

## Goal
Understand Linux networking by inspecting ports, connections,
and firewall behavior.

## Listening ports
Used ss to identify listening TCP ports and associated processes.

## Active connections
Observed established TCP connections and connection states.

## Connection behavior
Compared connection refused vs timeout scenarios to distinguish
application-level issues from network/firewall issues.

## Firewall basics
Used iptables to temporarily block traffic and observe its impact
on connectivity.

## Result
Gained practical understanding of Linux networking internals
relevant to troubleshooting and SRE operations.
